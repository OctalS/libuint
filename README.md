Libuint v1.0
================================

 **Author: vlad - octal.s@gmail.com**

A compact C library to deal with large unsigned integer numbers, as well as their logic and arithmetic.
It works with fixed size integers like `uint128_t`, `uint256_t`,  and so on.
It is 32/64 bit compatible.

Thus far, it has been tested on:
  
- x64    Linux/Fedora
- x64    Mac OS X
- i386   OpenBSD
- mips32 Linux/Busybox

See `doc/` for more info on how to use it
